# Business Scraper

A professional desktop application for searching and collecting business information using the Google Maps API.

## Background

I originally built this as a web application in an afternoon by combining parts from an old Perl project and an old Python project, then vibe-coding a front-end using HTML, CSS, and Node.js. The original project was created to help my friend Rhoan Egemo with his unpaid business internship, making it easier for him to gather business data.

The original web app is currently in a private GitHub repository because I naively exposed API keys in the first few commits. I'll make it public when I stop being lazy and retire those keys.

This C++ version is a complete rewrite using Qt for the desktop interface. I built it to practice making desktop applications and to create a more professional, standalone version of the tool.
